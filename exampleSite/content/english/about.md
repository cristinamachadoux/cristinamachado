Hello! I'm Cristina Machado from Barcelona,

A book enthusiast who has explored the literary world through a book-themed Instagram that reached 10k followers, collaborating with publishers, and leading a book club for a year. Traveling is one of my passions and I enjoy everything around it, such as organizing trips, creating detailed maps, and keeping journals that capture the best moments of my adventures. Additionally, I enjoy immortalizing memories through photographs, attending concerts, and being surrounded by cats, among other things. These interests led me to my true passion: UX/UI Design. 

My background, including experience in public tenders at a construction company and as a Project Coordinator/Purchasing Manager in a start-up, has shaped me into a methodical, organized, responsible, and versatile individual. Meetings with suppliers, market research, preparation of essential documents, and managing Mailchimp communications to clients are just a few of the responsibilities that have expanded my skill set.

I am always excited about personal and professional growth and learning.
